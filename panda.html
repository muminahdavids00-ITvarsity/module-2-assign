                        <h3>PANDA</h3>
                        <p>In the wild, giant pandas will eat a variety of grasses, wild tubers, and even meat from birds, rodents, or carrion. They may be fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas in captivity, as well as specially prepared meals. The giant panda can be found in a few mountain ranges in central China, primarily in Sichuan but also in Shaanxi and Gansu. The giant panda has been forced out of the lowland areas where it formerly thrived as a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, and it is now a conservation-dependent vulnerable species.</p>
                             <p>According to a 2007 study, there are 239 pandas in captivity in China and another 27 outside the country. In December 2014, there were 49 giant pandas in captivity outside of China, spread across 18 zoos in 13 countries. There are roughly 1,590 individuals living in the wild, according to one estimate, but a 2006 research using DNA analysis estimated that this number might be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. According to some accounts, the number of wild giant pandas is increasing.</p>
                            
                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM ?</p></strong>
                            <p>Because the giant panda shares features with both bears and raccoons, its exact taxonomic categorization has been debated for decades. Molecular investigations, on the other hand, show that the giant panda is a real bear belonging to the Ursidae family.</p>
