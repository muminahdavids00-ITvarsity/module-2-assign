                        <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                        <p>Monkey is a common name for a variety of mammalian taxa, including the simians of the infraorder Simiiformes. The phrase is used to describe groups of primates, such as New World monkey families and Old World monkey families. Many monkey species are arboreal (live in trees), however some, such as baboons, live mostly on the ground. The majority of animals are most active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are widely seen to be clever, especially Catarrhini's Old World monkeys. Simians and tarsiers first appeared 60 million years ago within haplorrhines. New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys appeared 35 million years ago within the simians. Some 25 million years ago, Old World monkeys and Hominoidea developed from the catarrhine monkeys. Primatologists regard extinct basal simians like Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus eosimiidea, as well as the Catarrhini group, to be monkeys. Strepsirrhini primates, such as lemurs, lorises, and galagos, are not monkeys. Tarsiers are haplorrhine primates, like monkeys, yet they are not monkeys.</p>
                             <p>Apes evolved from "monkeys" as sisters of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, making them cladistically monkeys. Because there has been a reluctance to label apes (and hence humans) as monkeys, "Old World monkey" could refer to the Cercopithecoidea or Catarrhini.</p>
                            
                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM ?</p></strong>
                            <p>Monkeys of various species have different connections with humans. Some are kept as pets, while others are utilized in laboratories or on space missions as model organisms. They may be utilized as assistance animals for the disabled or slaughtered in monkey drives (when they pose a hazard to agriculture).</p>
