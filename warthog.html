                        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                        <p>Although clothed with bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear mostly naked from a distance, with the exception of the crest along the back and the tufts on their cheeks and tails. The English name relates to the wattles on their faces, which are especially prominent in males. They also have distinctive tusks that grow from 10 to 25 inches in length in males but are always smaller in females. They are mostly herbivores, but they do consume small animals on occasion. The nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, generally known as the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865, despite the fact that both species are still reasonably abundant and widespread, and are thus classified as Least Concern by the IUCN.</p>

                            <p>Pumbaa, a warthog, and Timon, a meerkat, play pivotal roles in Disney's 1994 animated picture The Lion King and its sequels.</p>
