                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                        <p>Gemsbok have a pale brownish-grey to tan coloration, with lighter patches on the rump's underside. Their black tails are long and slender. A blackish stripe runs from the chin to the lower border of the neck, across the shoulder and leg juncture on each side's lower flank, and to the blackish part of the rear leg. They feature muscular necks and shoulders, and white'socks' with a black patch on the front of both front legs, as well as long, straight horns in both genders. The East African oryx, on the other hand, does not have a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and has less black on the lower flanks. The "golden oryx" is an extremely unusual color morph in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden. The Gemsbok is the largest species in the Oryx genus. At the shoulder, they stand around 1.2 m  The body length varies from 190 to 240 cm , with a tail length of 45 to 90 cm Female gemsbok weigh 100–210 kg , whereas males weigh between 180 and 240 kg.</p>
                             <p>Gemsbok are targeted for their magnificent horns, which measure an average of 85 cm  in length. The only visible difference between males and females from a distance is their horns, and many hunters mistake females for males every year. Male horns are thicker and have broader bases. Females have horns that are slightly longer and thinner than males. Male gemsbok utilize their horns to defend their territories from other males, while female gemsbok use them to defend themselves and their babies from predators. Female trophies are occasionally more valuable than male trophies in Gemsbok, one of the few antelope species where this is the case. According to some authorities, a gemsbok horn can be fashioned into a natural trumpet and used as a shofar..</p>
