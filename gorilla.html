                        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                        <p>Gorillas are huge animals belonging to the Gorilladaesa family and the Proboscidea order. The African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) are the two species conventionally recognized, while some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are different species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Gorillas can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. Other extinct members of the order Proboscidea include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Gorillas are the sole surviving family of the order Proboscidea. Male African elephants are the world's largest extant terrestrial creatures, standing at 4 meters Â tall and weighing 7,000 kilograms.</p>

                            <p>Gorillas are herbivores that live in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They want to be close to water.</p>
