                        <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                        <p>Elephants are enormous mammals belonging to the Elephantidae family and the Proboscidea order. The African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) are the two species conventionally recognized, while some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are different species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. Elephantidae is the sole surviving family of the order Proboscidea, which also includes deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons, all of which are now extinct. Male African elephants are the world's largest land creatures, reaching heights of 4 meters and weighing 7,000 kilograms.</p>
                             <p>Elephants have various distinguishing characteristics, the most noteworthy of which is a long trunk, or proboscis, which is utilized for a variety of tasks, including breathing, lifting water, and gripping objects. Their incisors develop into tusks, which can be used as weapons as well as tools for excavating and moving stuff. Elephants use their enormous ear flaps to regulate their body temperature. Their massive weight is supported by their pillar-like legs. Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs, whereas African elephants have larger ears and concave backs.</p>
                             <P>Elephants are herbivores that live in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They want to be close to water.</P>
                            
                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM ?</p></strong>
                            <p>The elephants may be found in enclosure E22, just near to the amphitheatre.</p>
