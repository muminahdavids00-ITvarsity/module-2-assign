                        <h3>LION</h3>
                        <p>The lion  is a member of the Panthera genus and belongs to the Felidae family. It has a muscular physique with a deep chest, a short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the tail's end. Adult male lions have a prominent mane, which is sexually dimorphic. Females have a head-to-body length of 160–184 cm, while males have a length of 184–208 cm. It is a sociable animal that organizes itself into prides. Although some lions scavenge when opportunities present themselves and have been known to hunt humans, the lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>
                             <p>The lion prefers grasslands and savannas, but is not found in deep woods. It is more diurnal than other big cats, although when hunted, it adapts to being active at night and in the twilight. The lion once roamed throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, and Western and South Asia, but it is now restricted to a few scattered populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and a single severely endangered population in western India. It has been classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, owing to a population drop of roughly 43% across African countries since the early 1990s. Outside of specified protected areas, lion numbers are unsustainable. Although the reason of the decline is unknown, habitat degradation and confrontations with humans are the most significant factors.</p>
                            
                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM ?</p></strong>
                            <p>Several English scientists provided more data about the animal's biology throughout the nineteenth century. The koala is well recognized as a symbol of Australia due to its unusual appearance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has designated koalas as a vulnerable species.</p>
